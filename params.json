{"name":"JPMML","tagline":"Java PMML API","body":"### Welcome to JPMML Page.\r\n\r\nThis is the homepage of the PMML project. It's an implementation in Java of the [PMML](http://www.dmg.org/v4-1/GeneralStructure.html) language.\r\n\r\nIt allows you to evaluate a model in PMML, or to generate a Java code that is equivalent to what does the model. I, @tbadie, am the current maintainer and I am working as a [Turn](turn.com) employee.\r\n\r\nThis project is intended to be open-source, which means that bug reports, questions, discussions and contributions are more than welcome.\r\n\r\nThe [wiki](https://github.com/turn/jpmml/wiki) is currently under construction but will contain all the ressources about the project.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading and hope you'll enjoy the project.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
